# Until It Happens

"I never thought it would happen to me."
These words echo through countless lives shattered by digital threats.

## About

Until It Happens is more than a platform—it's a response to the silent epidemic of cyber victimization. We exist because every day, someone's grandmother loses her life savings to an AI-generated voice of a loved one. Because a small business owner watches decades of work vanish in a ransomware attack. Because a teenager's life unravels from digital exploitation.

We make cybersecurity human. Accessible. Personal.

## Our Focus

**Digital Footprint Analysis**
Understanding what the digital world knows about you—before others exploit it.

**Security Education**
Knowledge delivered with clarity and purpose, not complexity.

**Threat Awareness**
Real stories. Real consequences. Real solutions.

**AI Fraud Prevention**
As technology evolves, so do the threats. We keep you ahead.

## Technical Foundation

Built on Next.js 14, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. But the technology isn't the story—it's the lives we protect.

## A Personal Note

Every line of code in this project represents someone's story—someone who wished they had known sooner. Someone who thought it couldn't happen to them.

Until it did.
