# Until It Happens

### Website under Development

"I never thought it would happen to me."
These words echo through countless lives shattered by digital threats.

## About

Until It Happens is more than a platform—it's a response to the silent epidemic of cyber victimization. We exist because every day, someone's grandmother loses her life savings to an AI-generated voice of a loved one. Because a small business owner watches decades of work vanish in a ransomware attack. Because a teenager's life unravels from digital exploitation.

We make cybersecurity human. Accessible. Personal.

## Our Focus

**Digital Footprint Analysis**
We've built sophisticated scanning tools that work like a digital mirror, showing you what others see. Because understanding your exposure is the first step to protection.

**Security Education**
Modern threats require modern solutions. Our guides combine technical precision with real-world context, making complex security concepts feel natural and actionable.

**Threat Awareness**
We monitor emerging threats in real-time, analyzing attack patterns and translating technical data into human impact. Because numbers without stories are just statistics.

**AI Fraud Prevention**
Our AI detection systems work silently in the background, while you focus on what matters—connecting with real people, safely and confidently.

## Technical Foundation

We leverage cutting-edge technology to protect what's human:
- Next.js 14 powers our responsive, real-time protection
- TypeScript ensures our security checks are precise and reliable
- Modern web technologies make safety feel natural, not forced

## A Personal Note

Every line of code in this project represents someone's story—someone who wished they had known sooner. Someone who thought it couldn't happen to them.

Until it did.
